  HOW TO INSTALL

Build the IAVISA Cloud Test library by changing  in either the
Release or Debug directory and type 'make'. Move the resulting
libiavisa-1.0.a static library  to a path appropriate for your
development environment.

Create a new IAVISA home directory and  copy the 'auxdata' and 
'database' folders into the newly created directory.

Set the environment variable 'IAVISA_HOME' to your IAVISA home
directory.
